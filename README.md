# Vision-Based-SLAM-and-Intelligent-Path-Planning-using-RRT-
A compact autonomous robot using Raspberry Pi integrates SLAM, YOLOv5 for real-time human detection, and RRT* for optimal path planning. It maps surroundings, detects a person as a goal, and navigates safely. Built in Python, it's lightweight and ideal for rescue, assistance, and indoor navigation.
